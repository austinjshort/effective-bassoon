3. Scroll down the document and, directly after the closing </article> tag,
 insert a div element with the ID eventList. It is within this element that you
 will write the HTML code for the table of upcoming theater events. Close the 
file saving your changes. 
(Hint: Be sure to review this file and all the support files, noting especially 
the names of variables that you will be using in the code you create.) 

4. Go to the lht_table.js file in your editor. Below the comment section, 
declare a variable named thisDay containing the date August 30, 2018. You will 
use this date to test your script. 

5. Create a variable named tableHTML that will contain the HTML code of the 
events table. Add the text of the following HTML code to the initial value 
of the variable: <table id='eventTable'> <caption>Upcoming 
Events</caption> <tr><th>Date</th><th>Event</th><th>Price</th></tr> 

6. Lewis only wants the page to list events occurring within 14 days after
 the current date. Declare a variable named endDate that contains a Date 
object that is 14 days after the date stored in the thisDay variable. 
(Hint: Use the new Date() object constructor and insert a time value that is
 equal to thisDay.getTime() + 14*24*60*60*1000.) 

7. Create a for loop that loops through the length of the eventDates array.
 Use i as the counter variable. 

8. Within the for loop insert the following commands in a command block: 
a. Declare a variable named eventDate containing a Date object with the date
 stored in the ith entry in the eventDates array. 
b. Declare a variable named eventDay that stores the text of the eventDate 
date using the toDateString() method. 
c. Declare a variable named eventTime that stores the text of the eventDate 
time using the toLocaleTimeString() method. 
d. Insert an if statement that has a conditional expression that tests whether 
thisDay is ≤ eventDate and eventDate ≤ endDate. If so, the event falls within 
the two-week window that Lewis has requested and the script should add the 
following HTML code text to the value of the tableHTML variable. 
<tr> <td>eventDay @ eventTime</td> <td>description</td> <td>price</td> </tr> 
where eventDay is the value of the eventDay variable, eventTime is the value 
of the eventTime variable, description is the ith entry in the eventDescriptions
 array, and price is the ith entry in the eventPrices array. 

9. After the for loop, add the text of the HTML code </table> to the value of the 
tableHTML variable. 

10. Insert the value of the tableHTML variable into the inner HTML of the page 
element with the ID eventList. 

11. Document your code in the script file using appropriate comments. 

12. Save your changes to the file, and then load the lht_events.html file in 
your browser. Verify that the page shows theater events over a two-week period
 starting with Friday, August 31, 2018 and concluding with 
Wednesday, September 12, 2018.
