1. Use your editor to open the bc_fed_txt.html and bc_keys_txt.js files from the html12 > 
review folder. Enter your name and the date in the comment section of each file, and
 save them as bc_fed.html and bc_keys.js respectively. 

2. Go to the bc_fed.html file in your editor. Directly above the closing </head> tag, 
link the page to the bc_keys.js JavaScript file, loading the file asynchronously. 
Take some time to study the contents of the HTML file and then close it, saving 
your changes. 

3. Go to the bc_keys.js file in your editor. Add event listeners to run 
the findKeyWords() and makeKeyStyles() functions when the page is loaded. 

4. Create the findKeyWords() function to locate the keywords from the document and
 generate the keyword list. Within the findKeyWords() function, perform the tasks 
described in steps 5 through 10. 

5. Create an aside element with the ID “keywords” and containing an h1 heading with 
the text “Keyword List”.

6. Create an ol element and append it to the keywords aside element. 

7. Next, generate the list of keywords and add IDs to each keyword entry in the
 source article. Create an object collection named keyWordElems referencing all 
dfn elements within the doc article 
(Hint: Use the querySelectorAll() method.) 
Create an array named keyWords with a length equal to the length of the keyWordElems
 collection. Add a for loop that loops through all the items in the keyWordElems
object collection, and for each item do the following: 
a. Set the value of each item in the keyWords array to the text of the corresponding 
item in the keyWordElems object collection. 
b. Next, set the ID of the current item in the keyWords array. However, the ID 
cannot contain blank spaces. Norene has supplied you with the replaceWS() function 
to replace blank spaces with the “_” character. Call the replaceWS() function with 
the current keyword as the parameter value and store the value returned by the
 function in the linkID variable. 
c. Set the ID of current item in the keyWordElems object collection to
 “keyword_linkID” where linkID is the value of the linkID variable. 

8. Sort the keyWords array in alphabetical order. 

9. Next, generate the list items in the keyword list. Add a for loop that loops
 through each item in the keyWords array, doing the following for each item: 
a. Declare the keyWordListItem variable, storing an li element. 
b. Declare the keyWordLink variable storing an a element. 
c. Change the innerHTML of keyWordLink to the value of the text of the current keyword. 
d. Declare the linkID variable containing the value returned by the replaceWS() 
function using the current keyword as the parameter value. 
e. Change the href attribute of keyWordLink to “#keyword_linkID” where linkID is 
the value of the linkID variable. 
f. Append keyWordLink to keyWordList and then append keyWordList to the ordered list 
you created in Step 6.

10. Insert the keywords list box you defined in Step 5 as the first child of the 
article element with the ID “doc”. 

11. Next, create the makeKeyStyles() function that will define the style sheet
 for the keywords box. Add the following commands to the function: 
a. Create an embedded style sheet and append it to the document head. 
b. Add the following style rules to the style sheet: aside#keywords 
{ border: 3px solid rgb(101, 101, 101); float: right; margin: 20px 0px 20px 20px; 
padding: 10px; width: 320px; } aside#keywords h1 
{ font-size: 2em; margin: 5px; text-align: center; } 
aside#keywords ol { margin-left: 20px; font-size: 1.2em; }
 aside#keywords ol li { line-height: 1.5em; } aside#keywords ol li a 
{ color: rgb(101, 101, 101); text-decoration: none; } 

12. Document your code with comments throughout the JavaScript file and then
 save your changes. 

13. Open the bc_fed.html file in your browser and verify 
that the page resembles the content and layout shown in Figure 12-53. 
Verify that you can click the entries in the keyword list to go to the 
corresponding term in the Federalist 10 article.
